# password-manager
A rudimentary password manager. 

This is just a tool for personal use. It is far from ideal in terms of 
security but, compared to my previous approach of storing password in 
plain text, it is a clear improvement.

This is basically a python script that uses gpg under the hood to manage
passwords.
